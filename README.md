## Site Info

* Ludmilla-Mary is designed as a portfolio for a fictional character created by the artist 2fik . The purpose of the website is to encourage people to be fierce by embracing Ludmilla-Mary’s catwalk activism philosophy.  There is also a contact page which can be used to register to Ludmilla-Mary’s newsletter. Ludmilla-Mary’s website lends his character more complexity and anchors him even more in our reality. The website  is a touching, funny and insolent representation of Ludmilla-Mary. 
This website is targeted towards 2fik’s art work supporters who follow Ludmilla-Mary’s tribulations. Ludmilla-Mary’s website will be useful for followers or newcomers to understand  her colorfull world. It is as well a  good illustration for an influencer parody portfolio where laughters are combined with curiosity.

* This is my Project Portfolio 1 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. Technologies used include HTML, CSS.

## User Experience (UXD)

-   ### User stories

- A first time user experience:  To be intrigued and want to discover who’s Ludmilla-Mary and to understand the motto of Landing page Be Fierce, Be Real, Be Me. The contact form is an invitation to access 
  more  information about the character.
-  Returning user experience: to dive  deeper into the strange world of Ludmilla-Mary  and enjoy  the ironic humor of the website and click to the social media to discover 2fik’s universe.
- Frequent user experience: to consider the website as an artistic curiosity.

- Main Objective: Get  new followers for Ludmilla-Mary and attention to the art work of 2Fik. To achieve our goals, the website muss be easy to navigate,  with a minimalist aesthetic to emphasise the pictures of Ludmilla-Mary illustrated with  text which underline her guerrilla catwalk activism philosophy. Some discret playfully call for action guidance bring the user to navigate furthermore. The skeleton of our design was based on hand made sketched wireframes of the desktop appearance.


  - ### Wireframes

   

   - The sketches indicate a strategy focused on the desktop first. The mobile version was main to be reflected with the flex-box reaction, considering that we have a desktop layout with two columns for all pages - except for Home page and confirmaton page. The idea was to count on the height perspective to pile up our content.
   - The picture as logo was abandonned due to technique difficulties and for a better time management.
   - The social media icons were reduced to 3 and postioned in the center of the footer for aesthetic purpose.
   - A video was added to the page Be Real in order to have a coherence with the page Be fierce.


   ### Issues Faced during development

    - Background-image was often used to avoid resizing issue with the images. But the gallery showed that it could have been possible to work with the chosen structure with the img element.
    - This indicates the possiblity to work later on the visual content to improve the quality of the images and give a better responsive sizing for all devices.
    - The text content once displayed in column required a lot proportions skills to offer a cohesive visual. The actual result is satisfactory but could be improved with more skills and time.
    

  - ### Design

  -   ### Website style
    - The style of the website chosen was 2 formats, one implemting to the Home-page and the Confirmation, the other one for Be Fierce, Be Real and Be Me. The navigation bar and the little expression above the footer allow the user to navigate to each page. The font-familly chosen for the text are the pair Dancing Script and Josefin Sans giving a feminine touch.

-   ### Imagery
    -  The visual cohesion is maintained by the photos that represent constantly Ludmilla-Mary. 

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The two dominant colors are pink and wite. The pink theme was taken with the chrome Developer tools color picker from one picture where Ludmilla-Mary is dressed in pink. The yellow and blue color schemes were chosen with the same technique.

_Nav bar testing_

 - Test each link on the nav bar. Each link took me to the relevant section required, the Logo took me home as expected. The nav bar stayed in place when scrolling ensuring the user has access to navigation at all times. Nav "active" page effect works as expected when clicking between pages and underlines blue.

_Nav, footer, logo and tip hover effects testing_

 - Test the expected result of the hover effect on the nav links, as well as the social media icon links on the footer and the tips text above the footer. All nav links and social media icons behaved as expected when hovering over with the mouse, all itemes change to yellow and inscreased their font-size.
