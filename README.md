## User Experience (UXD)

-   ### User stories

 - As a user I  can:

   - see a set of cards ranged in fourth rows and fourth columns style game with cards on display - these cards will have a front and back image.
   - read  easy and short explained rules by clicking the button rules
   -  escape the rule explanation by clicking the “x” or the the button play.
   - click a card to start the game
   - click only on two cards at a time, to try to find a matched pair.
   - play on a limited time - 60 seconds - to find all matched pair.
   - expect that once the game has been completed, the timer will stop.
   - receive a message of  victory and score at the end of the game when all matched pairs have been found.
   - receive a message to be informed that he has lost when the timer arrived at 0.
   -  close the pop up  victory or defeat messages by clicking  on the "x" button or  clicking the button try again.
   - Reset the game at any time during play.
   - can test his memory skills and enjoy the challenge to beat the timer.


  - ### Wireframes
    - All Wireframes were designed for laptop/computer, iPad/tablet and phone display.

   

   ### Issues Faced during development

    - Background-image was often used to avoid resizing issue with the images. But the gallery showed that it could have been possible to work with the chosen structure with the img element.
    - This indicates the possiblity to work later on the visual content to improve the quality of the images and give a better responsive sizing for all devices.
    - The text content once displayed in column required a lot proportions skills to offer a cohesive visual. The actual result is satisfactory but could be improved with more skills and time.
    

   ### Design

  -   ### Website style
    - The game is a single page site with several modals that act as popup windows. The style of the website is based 4 rows on 4 columns of cards. Above this display two buttons on their side indicator of time and moves on the top a title. The design should be simple and let the user to play without any distractions. It is designed as a playfull interactive memory game where the user can replay as many times as they wish. It might intrigues the user because all pictures are different characters personified by one person, the artist 2Fik. The timer of 60 seconds push the excitement of the user to find all pair matched or to beat a score if he has already playded.



-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The colour scheme was chosen to be soft and harmonious.
